            are net prices excluding value added tax, which the Customer must
            pay in addition at the respective statutory rate. Upon expiry of the
            payment deadline, the Customer is in default of payment. During
            default, FLABALE is entitled to demand default interest at the
            applicable statutory default interest rate (§§ 288, 247 German Civil
            Code), whereby FLABLE reserves the right to claim further damages.
            In case of a merchant, FLABLE reserves the right to claim interest
            as of the due date (§ 353 German Commercial Code). The Customer may
            only offset such claims that are undisputed or have been finally
            legally established without possibility to appeal or that are
            reciprocally linked to the main claim (e.g. claims of the Customer
            due to defects in performance).An entrepreneur may only withhold its
            counter-performance if such counter-performance is undisputed or has
            been finally legally established without possibility to appeal. In
            the event of default or non-performance of payments by the Customer,
            FLABLE is entitled to perform outstanding Deliveries only against
            advance payment or provision of security and, if the advance payment
            or security is not provided within two weeks, to withdraw from the
